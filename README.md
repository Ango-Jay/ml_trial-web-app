# ml_trial-web-app
My first Machine Learning web app😁

### Tech Stack:
- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- PythonShell (for linking Python and JavaScript code)
- Python

*NOTE*
Only works on titanic dataset

## How it works
- upload the titanic dataset(as a csv file) and watch as the application processes it and outputs the model's accuracy to the screen(pretty simple stuff🙃)
